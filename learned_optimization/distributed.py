"""Manages distributed training.

This module currently exposes an AsyncLearner which runs on a centralized
server, and AsyncWorker which runs on a multiple clients.

Workers grab the current weight values, and put back computed information.
This information usually contains a gradient estimate.
Batches of this info can be grabbed from the learner and used to compute
meta-weight updates. The resulting update can then be used to update the
meta-weights. Once updated, the meta-weights can wet back on the learner.

*learned\_optimization* is a research codebase for training, designing, evaluating, and applying learned
optimizers, and for meta-training of dynamical systems more broadly. It implements hand-designed and learned optimizers, tasks to meta-train and meta-test them, and outer-training algorithms such as ES, PES, and truncated backprop through time.

There is a third-party (alpha) [PyTorch wrapper for VeLO](https://github.com/janEbert/PyTorch-VeLO) (the current SOTA learned optimizer in this repository) by Jan Ebert.

## Quick Start Colab Notebooks
Our [documentation](https://learned-optimization.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) can also be run as colab notebooks! We recommend running these notebooks with a free accelerator (TPU or GPU) in colab (go to `Runtime` -> `Change runtime type`).

### Build a learned optimizer from scratch

Simple, self-contained, learned optimizer example that does not depend on the *learned\_optimization* library:

## Local Installation
We strongly recommend using virtualenv to work with this package.

```
pip3 install virtualenv
git clone git@github.com:google/learned_optimization.git
cd learned_optimization
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

## Train a learned optimizer example
To train a learned optimizer on a simple inner-problem, run the following:

`python3 -m learned_optimization.examples.simple_lopt_train --train_log_dir=/tmp/logs_folder --alsologtostderr`

This will first use tfds to download data, then start running. After a few minutes you should see numbers printed.

A tensorboard can be pointed at this directory for visualization of results. Note this will run very slowly without an accelerator.

File a github issue! We will do our best to respond promptly.

## Publications which use *learned\_optimization*

## Development / Running tests
We locate test files next to the related source as opposed to in a separate `tests/` folder.
Each test can be run directly, or with pytest (e.g. `python3 -m pytest learned_optimization/outer_trainers/`). Pytest can also be used to run all tests with `python3 -m pytest`, but this will take quite some time.

If something is broken please file an issue and we will take a look!
